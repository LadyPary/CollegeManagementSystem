You can create an empty database file with tables by running the <database_setup.py> file from Data folder. Make sure to delete the existing database before creating a new one.    

You can print and see all the information from database by running the <see_data> file. 

All the pages have been designed with QtDesigner and you can find them in <Ui_Classes> folder.
